# Tailwind CSS Styling Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are not applied correctly.  A simple button example is provided that should have a blue background and a hover effect, but does not. The solution shows how to correct the issue.

## Bug

The `bug.html` file contains the HTML code with the incorrectly applied Tailwind CSS classes. The button does not have the expected blue background or hover effect.  This may be due to a missing configuration or conflict with other CSS.
